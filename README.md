<p align="center"> Fig.1 User Interface </p>

In order to use this GUI,three files are needed and they should be placed in the same directory.For example:

1. subject_info.csv ------>the radar data file
2. subject_info.mp4(or any video format)
3. Subject_info_BELT.csv(_BELT should be capital)----->data from breathing belt

If you recorded some data yourself,please name them in such manner.

This program may take a lot of time to import the data,donâ€™t click anything when importing...only after the import is complete
